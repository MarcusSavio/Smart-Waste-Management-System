Title 1: "Smart Waste Management System Using IoT and Machine Learning"

Abstract:
The proposed project aims to develop a Smart Waste Management System leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology integrated with Machine Learning algorithms. 
The system will include smart waste bins equipped with sensors to detect fill levels and environmental parameters such as temperature and humidity. 
Data collected from these bins will be transmitted wirelessly to a central server for real-time monitoring and analysis. 
Machine Learning models will be employed to predict waste generation patterns, optimize collection routes, and schedule pick-ups efficiently. 
The project targets improved waste management practices, reduced operational costs, and minimized environmental impact through data-driven decision-making.
